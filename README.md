# Car-Resale Price Prediction

# Project Introduction:-
Due to the various elements that affect a used automobile's pricing,
determining whether the quoted price of a used car is accurate is a difficult
task. This project's main goal is constructing models that can reliably
predict future events and anticipate the price of a used automobile based
on its characteristics to make educated purchasing decisions. We put
things in place and analyze them with different learning algorithms on a
dataset made up of sales pricing of various manufacturers and models.
We'll compare the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques
like as. Random Forest Regression are all examples of regression
techniques. Choose the best out of an elastic net, a tree based regression,
and an extra tree regressor. A portion of it, we'll decide based on a number
of factors the car's cost. Because of this regression algorithms are
employed, it gives us continual value in the form of an output rather than a
product. Due to the obvious classified value, it will be possible to, rather
than predicting the price range of a car, forecast the exact pricing of a car.
In addition, a user interface has been created that collects data. any user's
input and shows the price of an automobile based on that input to the
user's input.

# Problem Statement
The manufacturer sets the price of a new car with the government incurring
some additional expenditures in the form of taxes. Customers who
purchase a new car may rest comfortable that the money they spend will
be well invested. However, due to rising new car prices, buyers' inability to
afford them, used car sales are on the rise all over the world. It may be
tough to determine whether a used car is worth the advertised price while
looking at ads online. Mileage, make, model, year, and other characteristics
can all have an impact on a car's true value. Pricing a used automobile
adequately is also an issue from the seller's perspective. As a result, there
is an urgent need for a Used Car Price Prediction system that accurately
analyzes the car's worthiness based on a range of factors. The goal is to
construct models for forecasting used car prices using machine learning
algorithms based on existing data.
