# Project Introduction:-
Due to the various elements that affect a used automobile's pricing,
determining whether the quoted price of a used car is accurate is a difficult
task. This project's main goal is constructing models that can reliably
predict future events and anticipate the price of a used automobile based
on its characteristics to make educated purchasing decisions. We put
things in place and analyze them with different learning algorithms on a
dataset made up of sales pricing of various manufacturers and models.
We'll compare the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques
like as. Random Forest Regression are all examples of regression
techniques. Choose the best out of an elastic net, a tree based regression,
and an extra tree regressor. A portion of it, we'll decide based on a number
of factors the car's cost. Because of this regression algorithms are
employed, it gives us continual value in the form of an output rather than a
product. Due to the obvious classified value, it will be possible to, rather
than predicting the price range of a car, forecast the exact pricing of a car.
In addition, a user interface has been created that collects data. any user's
input and shows the price of an automobile based on that input to the
user's input.
