# Problem Statement

The manufacturer sets the price of a new car with the government incurring
some additional expenditures in the form of taxes. Customers who
purchase a new car may rest comfortable that the money they spend will
be well invested. However, due to rising new car prices, buyers' inability to
afford them, used car sales are on the rise all over the world. It may be
tough to determine whether a used car is worth the advertised price while
looking at ads online. Mileage, make, model, year, and other characteristics
can all have an impact on a car's true value. Pricing a used automobile
adequately is also an issue from the seller's perspective. As a result, there
is an urgent need for a Used Car Price Prediction system that accurately
analyzes the car's worthiness based on a range of factors. The goal is to
construct models for forecasting used car prices using machine learning
algorithms based on existing data.
